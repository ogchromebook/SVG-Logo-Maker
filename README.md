# SVG Logo Generator

## Description

The Logo Generator CLI is a simple command-line tool designed to help freelance web developers and hobbyists create custom logos quickly and efficiently. The motivation behind this project was to eliminate the need to hire a graphic designer for creating basic logos, thereby saving time and resources. This project was built to automate the logo creation process, allowing users to generate SVG logos with customized text and shapes in just a few steps.

This project solves the problem of needing a fast, easy, and cost-effective way to create logos without any design skills. Throughout the development of this project, I learned more about handling user input in a command-line environment, generating SVG files programmatically, and writing unit tests for JavaScript applications.
